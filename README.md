ServiceBuilding

Working-class people often have many barriers to filing complaints about government agencies - agencies respond to issues like incompetency or discrimination mostly at-will, filing these reports is often an extended process that can involve interviews and documentation, and documentation and interviews for these reports usually must happen in the limited hours the agency is open. Folks will often reflect on these experiences on social media or to friends, but it becomes difficult to hold these agencies accountable when there isn't a centralized paper-trail of these incidents.

My idea is to create a platform where people can share reviews of government agencies, particularly of difficult experiences, in an effort to have this information in one place. The app will include data visualization to help people make more informed decisions about the government offices they go to, as well as to help organizers and activists better hold these agencies accountable to behaving equitably.

Reach Goals:
1. User should be able to access data visualization for the kinds of interactions had at a particular location
2. User should be able to leave anonymous interaction
